#Python Practice Programs for Beginners

1. <a href="https://github.com/raamcoumar/Python-Practice-for-beginners/blob/master/Draw-circle-withs-quares.py">Draw Circles with Squares</a>:
A simple program to draw circles with squares using the <i>Turtle</i> package

2. <a href="https://github.com/raamcoumar/Python-Practice-for-beginners/blob/master/Calendar.py">Basic Calendar</a>:
we'll build a basic calendar that the user will be able to interact with from the command line. The user should be able to choose to:
-View the calendar
-Add an event to the calendar
-Update an existing event
-Delete an existing event

3. <a href="https://github.com/raamcoumar/Python-Practice-for-beginners/blob/master/Rock-Paper-Scissors.py">Rock-Paper-Scissor</a>
  The program does the following:
  -Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors
  -Instruct the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors
  -Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice
  -Determine a winner (the user or the computer)
  -Inform the user who the winner is
  
4. <a href="https://github.com/raamcoumar/Python-Practice-for-beginners/blob/master/BattleShip_game.py">Battle Ship Game</a>
  In this project you will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship.
  
5. <a href="https://github.com/raamcoumar/Python-Practice-for-beginners/blob/master/WikiCrawler.py">Automating Wikipedia Crawler</a>
There was an idea floating around that continuously following the first link of any Wikipedia article will eventually lead to “Philosophy.” Whilst it's interesting to click through Wikipedia, it takes a lot of time to click through and read all those articles. We're going to work on automating this process, ending up with a program that will go through Wikipedia for us, keeping track of the first links on each page and untill they reach the page 'Philosophy'.
